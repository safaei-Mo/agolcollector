## developing a JavaScript-only full stack with a Mobile First Design strategy

### (Mobile First Design strategy means the design will be optimized for mobile devices and scaled to desktop devices)
###  The goal is to create a front-end interface that can be easily used on the go to read and write to an ArcGIS Online (AGOL) database. 

### This enables users to collect data from their smartphone or desktop web browsers, and the collected data will be written and updated in datasets stored on AGOL.
